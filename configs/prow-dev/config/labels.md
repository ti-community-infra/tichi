## Intro

This file was auto generated by the [label_sync](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/label_sync/) tool,
based on the [labels.yaml](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi/blob/master/configs/prow-dev/config/labels.yaml) that it uses to
sync github labels across repos in the [kubernetes github org](https://github.com/kubernetes)

### Why these labels?

The rule of thumb is that labels are here because they are intended to be produced or consumed by
our automation (primarily prow) across all repos. There are some labels that can only be manually
applied/removed, and where possible we would rather remove them or add automation to allow a 
larger set of contributors to apply/remove them.

### How do I add a new label?

- Add automation that consumes/produces the label
- Open a PR, _with a single commit_, that:
  - updates [labels.yaml](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi/blob/master/configs/prow-dev/config/labels.yaml) with the new label(s)
  - runs `scripts/update-labels.sh` (to regenerate the label descriptions)
- Involve [sig-community-infra](https://developer.tidb.io/sig/community-infra) in the change, eg: chat about it in slack, mention @ti-community-infra/sig-community-infra in the PR, etc.
- After the PR is merged, a kubernetes CronJob is responsible for syncing labels daily
