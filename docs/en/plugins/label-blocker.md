# ti-community-label-blocker

## Design Background

Throughout the [PR collaboration process](en/workflows/pr-old.md), some labels are recognized and used by the bot, for example, to determine if a PR can be merged based on whether it has a `status/can-merge` label. For these sensitive labels, we don't want them to be added or removed at will, so we designed the ti-community-label-blocker plugin to help us control the permissions for adding or removing such labels.

## Permission design

This plugin is mainly responsible for restricting the add or delete behavior of some labels of Issue or PR. For a label that needs to be controlled, only the operator is allowed to operate normally if he is a trusted user in the configuration or a member of the trusted team.

## Design

The plugin will match the rules of the added or deleted labels according to the rules, and the matched label will be automatically removed or re-added by the plugin if they are added or deleted by untrusted users.

For trusted users, i.e. trusted Github users or members of a trusted Github team, their actions on labels are not affected.
