# Prow Introduction

## About Prow

[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) is a Kubernetes based CI/CD system. 
Jobs can be triggered by various types of events and report their status to many services. In addition to job execution, Prow provides GitHub automation in the form of policy enforcement, chat-ops via /foo style commands, and automatic PR merging.

## Prow in TiDB community

In [tichi](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi), the focus is on automating and standardizing the [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) community's collaboration process using the GitHub automation features provided by Prow.

Because Prow is so [extensible](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/plugins), it is possible to write and customize [plugins](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi/tree/master/internal/pkg/externalplugins) according to your own community practice specifications.
The TiDB community has customized a number of its own plugins based on this feature.

## Common plugin list

The following shows some commonly used components or plugins in the TiDB community. The external plugins whose name begin with `ti-community-` are developed and maintained by the [Community Infra SIG](https://developer.tidb.io/SIG/community-infra) of TiDB community. If you encounter any problems during use, you can contact us in [Slack](https://slack.tidb.io/invite?team=tidb-community&channel=sig-community-infra&ref=github).
